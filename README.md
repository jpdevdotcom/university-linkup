## ⚠️ Missing Files
For security and privacy, some core logic files are excluded.

Instead, we provide `*.example.ts` / `*.example.py` files as **stubs**.  
These allow the project to run, but you’ll need to implement your own logic for:
- Real WebSocket chat
- Neural network decoding/registration
- Backend chat consumer

This ensures the repo is open-source while keeping sensitive logic private.
